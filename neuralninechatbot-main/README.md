Chat bot created using Neural Nine's tutorial.

Save the intents.json, the training.py, and the chatbot.py in the same folder. 

You can edit the intents.json if you would like.

Steps after you download the files:
1. Open the training.py file, and wait for the chatbot to learn the words sentences.
2. Open the chatbot.py file, and you should be able to chat!

If you run into an error with any of the modules, make sure to pip install [module].
